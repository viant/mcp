// Package term shows an experimental end-to-end flow that exercises the MCP
// authorization stack using a browser-based OAuth 2.1 flow.
//
// It is intentionally kept separate from the main `example/auth/term` package so
// that breaking experiments can be iterated on without affecting the stable
// examples.
